## Abstract
For this project, we wanted to apply concepts from vector calculus to ﬁnd the airﬂow around any 2-dimensional shape. We made the assumptions that air is an incompressible and irrotational ﬂuid in order to reduce the scope of our project while maintaining a realistic outcome. Through the use of the relaxation algorithm and the application of ghost points internal to our shape, we were able to produce vector-plots visualizing the air velocity around an object.
